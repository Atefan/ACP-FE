# ACP-BE
To create a project that tracks the progress for a company with various roles and responsibilities, we need to design a system that supports the different functionalities for admins, managers, chapter leads, and employees. Here is a conceptual overview of how you can structure this project:

# Define Roles and Responsibilities
Admins:
Create and manage user accounts.
Assign managers and chapter leads.
View reports and analytics.

Managers:
Manage a small number of chapter leads.
Rate chapter leads on different performance metrics.

Chapter Leads:
Lead and support employees.
Rate employees on different categories of their work once a month.

Employees:
Perform self-evaluation.
